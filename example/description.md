# Assignment 2: Special Numbers

---
We consider positive numbers that have exactly three different prime factors as being special. For example, 30 is special because $30=2^1*3^1*5^1$, while 210 is not special because $210=2^1*3^1*5^1*7^1$.

**What to do:** In SpecialNumber.java

[Task] Complete method <font color=' #A52A2A '>isSpecial</font> in class <font color=' #A52A2A '>SpecialNumber</font> so that the method returns true if and only if the argument is special.
